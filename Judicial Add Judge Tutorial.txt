###Step 0: To open the Judicial GUI
add this country flag into the tag: show_judicial_gui_flag

###Step 1: Add the Portrait GFXs
Portrait location: gfx/interface/erx_judicial_gui/erx_judges_frame.dds
There are two way to do this
Either:

Replace one of the previous used portraits slot

OR

Add the new portrait at the end of the image file

NOTE:If Adding a new portrait at the end, you will need to go to interface/erx_judicial_gui.gfx
and change the spriteType GFX_erx_judges_frame noOfFrames attribute by + 1

-The Placement of the Portrait GFXs will be used to display for the judges in-game.
Check gfx/interface/erx_judicial_gui/erx_judges_frame_template to see the placement example with the character IDs written on each frame

-The process of adding a new portrait is pretty self-explanatory, to whoever adding new judge reading this but can't
do that part, it's really a skill issue. Please contact @Deez or @SouthernHero for more information

###Step 2: Add the character in-game
Let's pretend the new character have the ID of 7

Run the effect to add the player to the list of available judge list (Optional)

add_to_arary = { erx_judges_list_array = 7 }

Run the effect to assign the judge directly to a commonwealth (Optional)
Lone Star Commonwealth's ID is 4

set_variable = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^4 = 7 }

Check if the judge's portrait show up in either available-for-hire list or in any of the 's judge position to see if the character is added
-If yes, continue. If not contact @Deez for more information

###Step 3: Add the character's party affiliation
Let's pretend the new character have the ID of 7
The system use arrays to keep track of which party the characters support, pick 1 below:

add_to_array = { erx_judges_party_people_array = 7 }			#People - New World Party
add_to_array = { erx_judges_party_intellectuals_array = 7 }		#Intellectual - Torch Party - Socialism Superiority - The best party in the game - Sponsored by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam - @Deez
add_to_array = { erx_judges_party_elites_array = 7 }			#Elites - Citizen's League
add_to_array = { erx_judges_party_ruler_array = 7 }				#Ruler - Granite Loyalist

The system will automatically display their party affiliation in-game, usually below their name in the GUI
If not added to one of the above arrays, their party affiliation will default to Neutral

###Step 4: Add the Character Short Name/Long Name/Description
Let's pretend the new character have the ID of 7

The current loc file for the Judicial gui is located in localisation/judicial_gui_l_english.yml
There is a section for the judges and you can basically figure out how to ctrl + C and ctrl + V. The loc key we'll be using:

judge_7_short_name: "Deez"						#Used to display on the GUI
judge_7_long_name: "Deez Nuts"					#Used when hover over the judge for more information
judge_7_desc: "§LDeez is a very cool person§!"	#Same with long_name but as a description style

Go to common/scripted_localisation/judicial_characters_scripted_localisation to add the new character ID into the system
There are 2 main version, the current and list
Current: Used to display the character's information when the judge is appointed in a commonwealth
List: Used to displayer the character's information when they are on the available-for-hire list

For Current: Add the new ID into the scripted loc with ctrl + C and ctrl + V with these loc keys
ERXGetCurrentJudgeShortName:
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^erx_judicial_gui_selected_com_var = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_short_name }

ERXGetCurrentJudgeLongName:
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^erx_judicial_gui_selected_com_var = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_long_name }

ERXGetCurrentJudgeDesc
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^erx_judicial_gui_selected_com_var = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_desc }

For List: Add the new ID into the scripted loc with ctrl + C and ctrl + V with these loc keys
ERXGetJudgeShortName
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { erx_judges_list_array^erx_judges_idx = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_short_name }

ERXGetJudgeLongName
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { erx_judges_list_array^erx_judges_idx = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_long_name }

ERXGetJudgeDesc
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { erx_judges_list_array^erx_judges_idx = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_desc }

###Step 5: Add a modifier
The Judge's modifiers are actually hidden ideas stored in common/ideas/erx_judicial_ideas.txt

You can follow the same format when addding new idea

judge_7_hidden_idea = {
	modifier = {
		resistance_activity = 0.05
	}
}

Give the idea to the hire/fire scripted effects of the character

erx_judge_hire_7_scripted_effect = {
	add_ideas = judge_7_hidden_idea
}

erx_judge_fire_7_scripted_effect = {
	remove_ideas = judge_7_hidden_idea
}

For scripted loc check the two loc key and follow their format

GetCurrentJudgeModifier
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^erx_judicial_gui_selected_com_var = 7 } } localization_key = idea_desc|judge_7_hidden_idea }

GetJudgeModifier
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { erx_judges_list_array^erx_judges_idx = 7 } } localization_key = idea_desc|judge_7_hidden_idea }

###Step 6: Adding special requirement to hire a judge
Check the scripted trigger file common/scripted_triggers/erx_judicial_gui_scripted_triggers.txt for more information
You can copy and paste many of the already set up checks and triggers
Example:

if = {
	limit = { check_variable = { erx_judges_list_array^erx_judges_idx = 7 } }
	has_political_power > 49
	has_stability > 0.6
}

NOTE: When requiring stuff like a political power cost, you should do something like add_political_power = -50 into the scripted
effect of hiring said character in Step 5
