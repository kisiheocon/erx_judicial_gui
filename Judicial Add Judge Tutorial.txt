###Step 0: To open the Judicial GUI
add this country flag into the tag: show_judicial_gui_flag

###Step 1: Add the Portrait GFXs
Portrait location: gfx/interface/ERX_judicial_gui/erb_judges_frame.dds
There are two way to do this
Either:

Replace one of the previous used portraits slot

OR

Add the new portrait at the end of the image file

NOTE:If Adding a new portrait at the end, you will need to go to interface/erx_judicial_gui.gfx
and change the spriteType GFX_ERB_judges_frame noOfFrames attribute by + 1

-The Placement of the Portrait GFXs will be used to display for the judges in-game.
Check gfx/interface/ERX_judicial_gui/erb_judges_frame_template to see the placement example with the character IDs written on each frame

-The process of adding a new portrait is pretty self-explanatory, to whoever adding new judge reading this but can't
do that part, it's really a skill issue. Please contact @Deez or @SouthernHero for more information

###Step 2: Add the character in-game
Let's pretend the new character have the ID of 7

Run the effect to add the player to the list of available judge list (Optional)

add_to_arary = { judges_list_array = 7 }

Run the effect to assign the judge directly to a commonwealth (Optional)
Lone Star Commonwealth's ID is 4

set_variable = { judicial_gui_com_judge_array^4 = 7 }

Check if the judge's portrait show up in either available-for-hire list or in any of the 's judge position to see if the character is added
-If yes, continue. If not contact @Deez for more information

###Step 3: Add the character's party affiliation
Let's pretend the new character have the ID of 7
The system use arrays to keep track of which party the characters support, pick 1 below:

add_to_array = { judges_party_people_array = 7 }			#People - New World Party
add_to_array = { judges_party_intellectuals_array = 7 }		#Intellectual - Torch Party - Socialism Superiority - The best party in the game - Sponsored by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam - @Deez
add_to_array = { judges_party_elites_array = 7 }			#Elites - Citizen's League
add_to_array = { judges_party_ruler_array = 7 }				#Ruler - Granite Loyalist

The system will automatically display their party affiliation in-game, usually below their name in the GUI
If not added to one of the above arrays, their party affiliation will default to Neutral

###Step 4: Add the Character Short Name/Long Name/Description
Let's pretend the new character have the ID of 7

The current loc file for the Judicial gui is located in localisation/judicial_gui_l_english.yml
There is a section for the judges and you can basically figure out how to ctrl + C and ctrl + V. The loc key we'll be using:

judge_7_short_name: "Deez"						#Used to display on the GUI
judge_7_long_name: "Deez Nuts"					#Used when hover over the judge for more information
judge_7_desc: "§LDeez is a very cool person§!"	#Same with long_name but as a description style

Go to common/scripted_localisation/judicial_characters_scripted_localisation to add the new character ID into the system
There are 2 main version, the current and list
Current: Used to display the character's information when the judge is appointed in a commonwealth
List: Used to displayer the character's information when they are on the available-for-hire list

For Current: Add the new ID into the scripted loc with ctrl + C and ctrl + V with these loc keys
GetCurrentJudgeShortName:
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { judicial_gui_com_judge_array^judicial_gui_selected_com_var = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_short_name }

GetCurrentJudgeLongName:
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { judicial_gui_com_judge_array^judicial_gui_selected_com_var = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_long_name }

GetCurrentJudgeDesc
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { judicial_gui_com_judge_array^judicial_gui_selected_com_var = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_desc }

For List: Add the new ID into the scripted loc with ctrl + C and ctrl + V with these loc keys
GetJudgeShortName
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { judges_list_array^judges_idx = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_short_name }

GetJudgeLongName
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { judges_list_array^judges_idx = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_long_name }

GetJudgeDesc
text = { trigger = { check_variable = { judges_list_array^judges_idx = 7 } } localization_key = judge_7_desc }
