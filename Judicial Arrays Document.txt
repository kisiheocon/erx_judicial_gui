NOTE: Below are arrays and informations that are useful and important to keep track of the amount of judges

1. Judge's IDs: Each character will be assigned with an ID for the game to keep track

1	Empty - Do not create a character with this ID, it's used for the game to know it's empty
2	Elizabeth Talbot
3	Joseph "Joey" DeVito
4	ADD MORE HERE

2. Used to keep track of the judges on the available-for-hire list:

erx_judges_list_array ^ erx_judges_idx = Judge IDs

erx_judges_idx = index used for the list to format
Judge IDs = the Judges IDs

Example: This array should only be fiddle with through scripted effect/trigger, directly messing with it in the gui can cause issues
erx_judges_list_array^erx_judges_idx = 2 #The judge on the list is Talbot/2 is Talbot's ID
erx_judges_list_array^erx_judges_idx = 3 #The judge on the list is Devito/3 is Devito's ID

Example in-game:
-Adding a new Judge into the list:
add_to_arary = { erx_judges_list_array = 3 } #Add DeVito into the available-for-hire list/3 is DeVito's ID

-Removing a Judge from the list:
remove_from_array = { erx_judges_list_array = 3 } #Remove DeVito from the available-for-hire list/3 is DeVito's ID

-When hire DeVito, give 30 pp. This should only be used in erx_judges_list_button_click_scripted_effect
if = {
	limit = { erx_judges_list_array^erx_judges_idx = 3 } #3 is DeVito's ID
	add_political_power = 30
}

3. Used to keep track of which judge each commonwealth currently employed:
NOTE: The system isn't designed to have more than 13 commonwealths, if you want to add more, contact @Deez
for more information

erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array ^ index = value

index = which commonwealth
value = which judge / judge's ID

0	Sierra Commonwealth
1	Cascadian Commonwealth
2	Four States Commonwealth
3	Great Northern Commonwealth
4	Lone Star Commonwealth
5	Great Lakes Commonwealth
6	Great Midwest Commonwealth
7	Appalachian Commonwealth
8	Empire Commonwealth
9	New England Commonwealth
10	Gulf Commonwealth
11	Dixie Commonwealth
12	Columbia Commonwealth

Example:
erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^0 = Elizabeth Talbot (Cause she will be the only judge in Sierra)
erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^1 = Whatever the ID of the judge employed in Cascadian Commonwealth

Example when used in-game:
-If Cascadian Commonwealth have DeVito, give 30 political power
if = {
	limit = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^1 = 3 } #If the judge of Cascadian Commonwealth is DeVito
	add_political_power = 30
}

-Assign DeVito as a judge for Cascadian Commonwealth
#remove_from_array = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array = 3 } #Remove Devito from judge position if he already in a position somewhere (OPTIONAL)
#remove_from_array = { erx_judges_list_array = 3 } #Remove Devito from the Available-for-hire judge list if he's on the list (OPTIONAL)
set_variable = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^1 = 3 } #1 is the ID of Cascadian Commonwealth/3 is the ID of DeVito

-Remove Devito if he's a judge for Cascadian Commonwealth
if = {
	limit = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^1 = 3 } #If the judge of Cascadian Commonwealth is DeVito
	set_variable = { erx_judicial_gui_com_judge_array^1 = 1 } #1 is the ID of Cascadian Commonwealth/1 is the ID of Empty
	#add_to_arary = { erx_judges_list_array = 3 } #3 is the ID of Devito, add him back to the available-for-hire list (OPTIONAL)
}

4. Used to keep track of judges's party affiliation

erx_judges_party_people_array			#People
erx_judges_party_intellectuals_array	#Intellectuals
erx_judges_party_elites_array			#Elites
erx_judges_party_ruler_array			#Ruler

Loc Keys:
erx_party_name_people					#NWP	New World Party
erx_party_name_intellectuals			#TP		Torch Party
erx_party_name_elites					#CL		Citizen's League
erx_party_name_ruler					#GL		Granite Loyalist
erx_party_name_neutral	#When a character isn't assigned to a party it will default to this

Example:
-Add DeVito to ruler party affiliation:
##Remove DeVito from other party first, this might not needed if the character won't ever switch party
#remove_from_array = { erx_judges_party_people_array = 3 } #3 is the ID of DeVito
#remove_from_array = { erx_judges_party_intellectuals_array = 3 } #3 is the ID of DeVito
#remove_from_array = { erx_judges_party_elites_array = 3 } #3 is the ID of DeVito
add_to_array = { erx_judges_party_ruler_array = 3 } #3 is the ID of DeVito

-If DeVito is in New World Party/People, give 30 political power:
if = {
	limit = { is_in_array = { erx_party_name_people = 3 } } #3 is the ID of DeVito
	add_political_power = 30
}

-Trigger require DeVito to be in Torch Party/Intellectuals:
is_in_array = { erx_party_name_intellectuals = 3 } #3 is the ID of DeVito
